      <div class="spoiler__inner">
        <p>Golf already has a single set of playing Rules, a single set of equipment Rules and a single set of Rules of Amateur Status governed by the USGA and The R&A.  Yet, today there are six different handicap systems used around the world.  Each is well developed and successfully provides equity for play locally, but each of the different systems produces slightly differing results when calculating playersâ€™ handicaps.  The WHS will unify these six existing systems into a single system that will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>enable golfers of different abilities to play and compete on a fair and equal basis, in any format, on any course, anywhere around the world;</li>
          <li>be easy to understand and implement, without sacrificing accuracy; and</li>
          <li>meet the varied needs and expectations of golfers, golf clubs and golf authorities all around the world and be adaptable to suit all golfing cultures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After significant engagement and collaboration with the existing handicapping authorities and other National Associations, it has been agreed that the time is right to bring the different handicapping systems together as a fourth set of Rules, to support the global game. </p>
        <p>In addition, this project has provided an opportunity for the existing handicapping authorities to come together and share their combined experiences to produce a system which is modern and relevant for the way the game is played today around the world.</p>
        <p>The WHS will encompass both the Rules of Handicapping and the Course Rating System (formerly known as the USGA Course Rating and Slope System).</p>
